# public-oddie-agents

## Mission
Build, test, and grow a personal library of AI agents that automate my daily work, self-improvement, trading, and personal life. This project will help me learn, save time, and build a public portfolio as the AI revolution unfolds.

## What this repo is for
- Personal workflow automation (email digests, scheduling, task reminders)
- Professional/data analyst copilots (summarization, reporting, research)
- Trading and finance tools (journal critique, macro news, alerts)
- Fitness, meal prep, and self-care agents
- Experiments with multi-agent teamwork (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)

## First milestone
**Automate my daily “Gmail to Notion” briefing:**  
- Reads my last 10 Gmail threads  
- Summarizes them using OpenAI  
- Posts the digest to my Notion “Daily Brief” page every morning

## Tech stack
- Python, OpenAI API, Gmail API, Notion API, TinyDB/Chroma
- git, GitHub Actions (for automation/cron)

## Why open source?
To learn in public, get feedback, and show my work to future employers or collaborators.
